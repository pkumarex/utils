## Deployment of Services

**Deploy SKC Service on CSP VM**

- Update the csp_skc.conf with the IP address of the CSP VM
- run install_csp_skc.sh
  - It will update all the required configuration files and install following services
- Check Service Status
  - netstat -nltp
  - Using services command line
    - cms status
    - authservice status
    - scs status
    - shvs status
    - ihub status
- Turn off Firewall service or ensure that these services can be accessed from the machine where SGX Agent/SKC_Library is running
   # systemctl stop firewalld


**Deploy SKC Service on Enterprise VM**

- Update the enterprise_skc.conf with the IP address of the Enterprise VM
- run install_enterprise_skc.sh
  - It will update all the required configuration files and install following services
- Check Service Status
  - netstat -nltp
  - Using services command line
    - cms status
    - authservice status
    - scs status
    - sqvs status
    - kbs status
- Turn off Firewall service or ensure that these services can be accessed from the machine where SGX Agent/SKC_Library is running
   # systemctl stop firewalld

## Build & Deployment of SGX Agent & SKC Library

**Build SGX_Agent**

cd into sgx_agent/build_scripts folder

Follow the instructions in README.build file


**Deploy SGX Agent** (To be run on SGX Enabled server)

cd into sgx_agent/deploy_scripts folder

Follow the instructions in README.install file


**Build SKC Library**

cd into skc_library/build_scripts folder

Follow the instructions in README.build file


**Deploy SKC Library** (To be run on SGX Enabled server)

cd into skc_library/deploy_scripts folder

Follow the instructions in README.install file


## Creating AES and RSA Keys in Key Broker Service

**Configuration Update to create Keys in KBS**

​	cd into kbs_scripts folder

​	Update KBS/AAS IP address in run.sh. Also update the CA_CERT with the pem file in /etc/kbs/certs/trustedca/ directory

**Create AES Key**

​	Execute the command

​	./run.sh
- Copy the key id generated

**Create RSA Key**

​	Execute the command

​	./run.sh reg

- copy the generated cert file to sgx machine where skc_library is deployed. Also copy the key id generated

## Configuration for NGINX testing

**Note:** OpenSSL and NGINX base configuration updates are completed as part of deployment script.

**OpenSSL**

[openssl_def]
engines = engine_section

[engine_section]
pkcs11 = pkcs11_section

[pkcs11_section]
engine_id = pkcs11

dynamic_path =/usr/lib64/engines-1.1/pkcs11.so

MODULE_PATH =/opt/skc/lib/libpkcs11-api.so

init = 0

**Nginx**

user root;

ssl_engine pkcs11;

Update the location of certificate with the loaction where it was copied into the skc_library machine. 

ssl_certificate "/root/nginx/nginxcert.pem"; 

Update the KeyID with the KeyID received when RSA key was generated in KBS

ssl_certificate_key "engine:pkcs11:pkcs11:token=KMS;id=164b41ae-be61-4c7c-a027-4a2ab1e5e4c4;object=RSAKEY;type=private;pin-value=1234";

**SKC Configuration**

​ Create keys.txt in /tmp folder. The keyID should match the keyID of RSA key created in KBS. Other contents should match with nginx.conf. File location should match on pkcs11-apimodule.ini; 

​	pkcs11:token=KMS;id=164b41ae-be61-4c7c-a027-4a2ab1e5e4c4;object=RSAKEY;type=private;pin-value=1234";

​	**Note:** Content of this file should match with the nginx conf file

​	**/opt/skc/etc/pkcs11-apimodule.ini**

​	**[core]**

​	preload_keys=/tmp/keys.txt

​	keyagent_conf=/opt/skc/etc/key-agent.ini

​	mode=SGX

​	debug=true

​	**[SW]**

​	module=/usr/lib64/pkcs11/libsofthsm2.so

​	**[SGX]**

​	module=/opt/intel/cryptoapitoolkit/lib/libp11sgx.so
