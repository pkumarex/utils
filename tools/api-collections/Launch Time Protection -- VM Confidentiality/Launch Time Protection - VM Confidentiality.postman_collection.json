		"name": "Launch Time Protection - VM Confidentiality",
		"description": "Workload Confidentiality builds upon Platform Attestation to protect\r\ndata in virtual machine images. At its core, this feature\r\nis about allowing an image owner to set policies that define the\r\nconditions under which their image will be allowed to run; if the policy\r\nconditions are met, the decryption key will be provided, and if the\r\nconditions are not met, the image will remain encrypted and\r\ninaccessible. This provides a level of enforcement beyond integration\r\nwith orchestrators, and protects sensitive data when the image is at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nWorkload Encryption relies on Platform Attestation to define the\r\nsecurity attributes of hosts. When a protected image is launched, the\r\nWorkload Agent on the host launching the VM image will\r\ndetect the attempt (using either Libvirt hooks for VMs and use\r\nthe Image ID to find the Image Flavor on the Workload Service. The\r\nWorkload Service will retrieve the current trust report for the host\r\nlaunching the image, and use that report to make a key retrieval request\r\nto the key transfer URL retrieved from the image flavor. The key\r\ntransfer URL refers to the URL to the image owner’s Key Broker Service,\r\nalong with the ID of the key needed.\r\n\r\nIn a typical production deployment, a Cloud Service Provider would\r\nenable Intel® SecL-DC security controls by installing the Intel® SecL-DC\r\napplications (with the exception of the Key Broker and Workload Policy\r\nManager), and configuring each workload host to be Trusted (as per the\r\nPlatform Integrity Attestation use case).\r\n\r\nThe owner of the workload image(s) to be protected (for example, the end\r\ncustomer of the CSP) must install a Key Broker Service (which must be\r\navailable for network communication from the Workload Service hosted on\r\nthe CSP), the Workload Policy Manager, and their own Authentication and\r\nAuthorization Service and Certificate Management Service (these will\r\nmanage authentication and certificates for the KBS and WPM).\r\n\r\nAny number of image owner customers with their own unique\r\nKBS/WPM/AAS/CMS deployments may protect images that can be run by a\r\nsingle CSP deployment.\r\n\r\nThe image owner will use the WPM to encrypt any image(s) to be\r\nprotected; the WPM will automatically create a new image encryption key\r\nusing the KBS, and will output the encrypted image and an Image Flavor.\r\nThe image owner can then upload the encrypted image to the CSP’s image\r\nstorage service, and then upload the Image Flavor to the CSP-hosted WLS.\r\n\r\nWhen a compute host at the CSP attempts to launch a protected image, the\r\nWLA on the host will detect the launch request, and will issue a key\r\ntransfer request to the WLS. The WLS will use the image ID to retrieve\r\nthe Image Flavor, which contains the key retrieval URL for that image.\r\nThis URL is hosted on the KBS of the image owner (which is why the KBS\r\nmust be available to network requests from the WLS). The WLS will access\r\nthe HVS to retrieve the current Platform Integrity Attestation report\r\nfor the host, and will use this report to make a key transfer request to\r\nthe KBS at the key transfer URL.\r\n\r\nThe KBS will receive the request, verify that the Platform Integrity\r\nAttestation report is signed using a known SAML signing key (verifying\r\nthat the report comes from a known and trusted HVS), and will then\r\nverify that the report shows that the host is trusted.\r\n\r\nIf these requirements are met, the KBS will use the host’s Binding Key\r\n(the public half of an asymmetric keypair generated by the host’s TPM\r\nand included in the attestation report) as a Key Encryption Key to seal\r\nthe Image Encryption Key to the TPM of the host that was attested.\r\n\r\nWhen the host receives the response to the key request, it will unseal\r\nthe Image Encryption Key using its TPM. Because the Key Encryption Key\r\nis unique to this host’s TPM, only the actual host that was attested\r\nwill be able to gain access to the image.\r\n\r\nWith the Image Encryption Key, the host’s WLA will create the\r\nappropriate encrypted volume(s) for the image and begin the launch as\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nThe WLA does not retain the key on disk; if/when the host is rebooted or\r\nthe WLA is restarted, restarting the workloads based on protected images\r\nwill trigger new key requests based on new Platform Integrity\r\nAttestation reports. In this way, if a host is compromised in a method\r\ndetectable by the Platform Integrity feature, protected images will be\r\nunable to launch on this server.",
