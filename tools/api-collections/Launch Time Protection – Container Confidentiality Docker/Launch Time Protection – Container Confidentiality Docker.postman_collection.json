		"name": "Launch Time Protection – Container Confidentiality Docker",
		"description": "Launch Time Protection - Container Confidentiality allows Docker container images to be encrypted at rest, with key access tied to platform integrity attestation.  Because security attributes contained in the platform integrity attestation report are used to control access to the decryption keys, this feature provides both protection for at-rest data, IP, code, etc in Docker container images, and also enforcement of image-owner-controlled placement policies.  When decryption keys are released, they are sealed to the physical TPM of the host that was attested, meaning that only a server that has successfully met the policy requirements for the image can actually gain access. \n\nWorkload Confidentiality builds upon Platform Attestation to protect data in container images. At its core, this feature is about allowing an image owner to set policies that define the conditions under which their image will be allowed to run; if the policy conditions are met, the decryption key will be provided, and if the conditions are not met, the image will remain encrypted and inaccessible. This provides a level of enforcement beyond integration\nwith orchestrators, and protects sensitive data when the image is at rest.\n\nWorkload Encryption relies on Platform Attestation to define the security attributes of hosts. When a protected image is launched, the Workload Agent on the host launching the container image will detect the attempt as a function of the Docker Secure Overlay Driver in the case of containers) and use the Image ID to find the Image Flavor on the Workload Service. The Workload Service will retrieve the current trust report for the host launching the image, and use that report to make a key retrieval request to the key transfer URL retrieved from the image flavor. The key transfer URL refers to the URL to the image owner’s Key Broker Service, along with the ID of the key needed.\n\nIn a typical production deployment, a Cloud Service Provider would enable Intel® SecL-DC security controls by installing the Intel® SecL-DC applications (with the exception of the Key Broker and Workload Policy Manager), and ensuring each workload host to be Trusted (as per the Platform Integrity Attestation use case).\n\nThe owner of the workload image(s) to be protected (for example, the end customer of the CSP) must install a Key Broker Service (which must be available for network communication from the Workload Service hosted on the CSP), the Workload Policy Manager, and their own Authentication and Authorization Service and Certificate Management Service (these will manage authentication and certificates for the KBS and WPM).\n\nAny number of image owner customers with their own unique KBS/WPM/AAS/CMS deployments may protect images that can be run by a single CSP deployment.\n\nThe image owner will use the WPM to encrypt any image(s) to be protected; the WPM will automatically create a new image encryption key using the KBS, and will output the encrypted image and an Image Flavor. The image owner can then upload the encrypted image to the CSP’s image storage service, and then  upload the Image Flavor to the CSP-hosted WLS.\n\nWhen a compute host at the CSP attempts to launch a protected image, the secure docker daemon and secure docker plugin will detect the launch request and makes call to WLA for fetching the unsealed key, and further WLA will issue a key transfer request to the WLS. The WLS will use the image ID to retrieve the Image Flavor, which contains the key retrieval URL for that image. This URL is hosted on the KBS of the image owner (which is why the KBS must be available to network requests from the WLS). The WLS will access the HVS to retrieve the current Platform Integrity Attestation report for the host, and will use this report to make a key transfer request to the KBS at the key transfer URL.\n\nThe KBS will receive the request, verify that the Platform Integrity Attestation report is signed using a known SAML signing key (verifying that the report comes from a known and trusted HVS), and will then verify that the report shows that the host is trusted.\n\nIf these requirements are met, the KBS will use the host’s Binding Key (the public half of an asymmetric keypair generated by the host’s TPM and included in the attestation report) as a Key Encryption Key to seal the Image Encryption Key to the TPM of the host that was attested.\n\nWhen the host receives the response to the key request, it will unseal the Image Encryption Key using its TPM. Because the Key Encryption Key is unique to this host’s TPM, only the actual host that was attested will be able to gain access to the image.\n\nWith the Image Encryption Key, the host’s WLA send the Image Encryption Key to secure docker daemon the appropriate volume(s) in secure overaly2 driver for the image and begin the launch as normal\n\nThe WLA does not retain the key on disk; if/when the host is rebooted or the WLA is restarted, restarting the workloads based on protected images will trigger new key requests based on new Platform Integrity Attestation reports. In this way, if a host is compromised in a method detectable by the Platform Integrity feature, protected images will be unable to launch on this server.",
